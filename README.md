## My name is Canon Helpman and I am a sophmare at UNC Chapel Hill! I intend on majoring in CS and minoring in statistics. I am interested in CS because of my experience with COMP 110, an introductory programing course at UNC. I have taken COMP 110 and am currently enrolled in COMP 210 and COMP 290. Intermediate skills in Python and beginner skills in Java, HTML, CSS, Docker, and Git. 👋
